## About Me ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on backend development, specializing in designing and building scalable web services.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll usually find me reading epic fantasy novels, listening to metal, or diving into random new topics just for the fun of it.

My professional journey is marked by versatility and a continuous pursuit of learning, having invested many hundreds of hours in courses and tech projects ([see more here](https://www.bit.ly/GustEduJourney)).
