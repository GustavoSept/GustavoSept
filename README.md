## About Me 👋

Hello! I'm Gustavo, a Data Analyst transitioning from the CGI industry to a field that I find both fascinating and critical for our times. I've completed IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera and am eagerly diving into projects that pique my interests. My _current_ focus areas are primarily Finance, Economics, IoT and Health.
