## About Me 👋

Hello! I'm Gustavo, a Data Scientist in the making, transitioning from the CGI industry to a field that I find both fascinating and critical for our times. I've recently completed IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera and am eagerly diving into projects that pique my interests. My _current_ focus areas are primarily Finance, Economics, and Health.

My journey in Data Science started in April 2023, and I'm currently immersing myself in the ***near-endless world of Machine Learning***.

## Ongoing Projects 🛠️
### Economic Freedom Data Analysis 🌍

I'm currently working on an analysis of Economic Freedom against various socio-economic factors such as GDP per Capita, Gini Index, and more. The data sets are sourced from Heritage and the World Bank. Here's a glimpse of my research approach:

+ Examine Economic Freedom in relation to GDP per Capita, Gini Index, Real Interest Rate, etc.
+ Build a Machine Learning Predictive Model to approximate how much does Economic Freedom actually contribute to prosperity indicator, in context with Geopolitical, Cultural and SocioEconomic factors.
  + As of now, I need to acquire much more data regarding such factors, using APIs and webscraping.
