## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Gustavo, a Data Scientist in the making, transitioning from the CGI industry to a field that I find both fascinating and critical for our times. I've recently completed IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera and am eagerly diving into projects that pique my interests. My _current_ focus areas are primarily Finance, Economics, and Health.

My journey in Data Science started in April 2023, and I'm currently immersing myself in the ***near-endless world of Machine Learning***.
